						About me
						
					</h2>

					<p class="paragraph-4 about-me">

						Hi! My name is Kevin. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Loyola in Chennai. 
						I wasn't very interested in pursuing a career in Engineering so I took a year off to study
						for CAT in the hope of getting into IIM's.<br><br><br>

						The only reason I started preparing for CAT is that I didn't know of all
						the other career paths available like freelancing, starting a web design agency etc.
						I got 95 percentile in CAT and was called for interviews to many IIM's but my interest lay elsewhere.<br><br><br>

						So I started my own small e-commerce brand and now help other medium
						to large sized Foreign as well as Indian e-commerce brands 
						in their marketing and advertising.<br><br><br>

						But I realised that it was because of my year off that 
						I was able to explore other fields like advertising, marketing and design.
						But many do not have the opportunity to take a year off.<br><br><br>

						And I got to know that there's so many ways in which you 
						can make a rewarding career and not be stuck in a job you hate.
						But even when I tried to learn stuff on my own, I found it mostly catered to the American and European audience.<br><br><br>

						So I decided to start Alernately to help Indian college students
						and graduates learn about the other career and business opportunities available 
						in the market along with topics such as how to handle finances, taxes, the stock market, receiving payments from clients, invoicing and much more.
